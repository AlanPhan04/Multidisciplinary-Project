concept trip: each time data is observed, an algorithm is suitable
PAA: 
Database: K segments
Data Stream: PMC
Data point A, B arrives -> Max, Min between A and B
A new point X arrives -> Max, Min between 
max - min > 2 \epsilon -> Split into another segment

PCA: Piece-wise Constant Approximation

for a specific point J in (min, max): (Max + min) / 2 < \epsilon

Hybrid PCA: 1 buffer contains M windows

Each time a data point arrives -> Add into the window -> calculate max, min of the window -> add window into the buffer -> calculate max, min of the buffer. 

If max - min > 2 \epsilon
